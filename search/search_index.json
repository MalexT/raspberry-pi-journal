It is really simple to setup up and to keep up to date with the changes my ISP makes to my public IP address. Also I'm a cheap a$$ so I didn't want to pay for static IP address (this might change in the future). Another reason, a colleague of mine recommended it to me, another option is NoIP but this requires a monthly check-in to keep using their services.</p> <p>Login to duckDNS however you wish and create a subdomain, for a free account the limit is 5 subdomains which should be more than enough for recreational purposes.
