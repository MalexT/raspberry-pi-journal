# Raspberry PI Journal

Idea: Learn as much about self hosting, networking and creating relatively safe RPI that's exposed to the Internet.

This RPI can and probably will be used as a home server and/or a server that can host multiple web API's (with the intention that they will strictly communicate with one or two devices outside home network).
